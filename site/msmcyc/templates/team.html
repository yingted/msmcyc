			<h3>Angela Chao</h3>
			<p>Angela is a grade 12 student, currently enrolled in the Regional Enhanced Program at Glenforest Secondary School. During her free time, she loves to play volleyball, watch movies, and listen to classic rock music. Angela actively volunteers with the Credit Valley Hospital, AbleLiving Organization, and community sport camps. Through her involvement with MSMYC, she hopes to raise awareness among the voices of tomorrow to enable them to take action in support of the people who are affected by this devastating disease.</p>
			<h3>Allison Chen</h3>
			<p>Allison is a driven peer and leader who strives to consistently and actively participate within her school and community through various extracurriculars and volunteer engagements, which span across Interact, cross country,show choir, to volunteering at the hospital. Through her involvement with <abbr title="Multiple Sclerosis Mississauga Youth Committee">MSMYC</abbr>, she aims to encourage other youth to get involved and further develop the growth of mere interests into passions. Any spare time she has is dedicated, for the most part, to bettering herself and the community, with a vision to create an awareness of youth potential and engagement within the community to create long lasting positive change on our generation and the generations to follow.</p>
			<h3>Cathy Li</h3>
			<p>Cathy is currently completing her senior year in the International Baccalaureate Program. Aside from her involvement with the <abbr title="multiple sclerosis">MS</abbr> Society of Canada, she actively volunteers at her local hospital and is a Shad Valley Queen’s 2012 alumnus. As an avid musician and athlete, she teaches piano, and loves to be actively competing in sports, such as volleyball and soccer. On her long journey ahead, she hopes to inspire others to do things beyond their comfort zones.</p>
			<h3>Jessie Liu</h3>
			<p>Jessie Liu is a passionate high school student who is always full of energy. As an active member in both her school and community, she is involved in the International Baccalaureate Student League, Kicks for Kids, and several leadership conferences. Recently, Jessie had the experience of a lifetime volunteering in rural Kenya where she not only helped build a school, but gained a whole new appreciation for life. The children in Kenya taught her that happiness is unquantifiable and that each of us can be the change we want to see in this world.To Jessie, MSMYC is more than a leadership opportunity, it’s the engagement of youths to educate others, to help find a cure and most importantly, to be the change.</p>
			<h3>Neil Liu</h3>
			<p>Neil Liu is a vocal Grade 10 member in the community and attending the IB Program. As an active figure in the community, he was participated in many social events, as well as volunteered. I think the most important thing about MSMYC is the cooperation of students from different schools to accomplish a task and I really hope that we can make a difference. In my opinion, we youth can greatly benefit from participating in a community effort to support the excellent work of researchers and use this opportunity to get closer with our community, take an active role in an organization, exercise our leadership capabilities, and acquiring the skills we will need to apply throughout our lives. Raising money for a significant cause like the search for a cure for multiple sclerosis is, in my view, the perfect opportunity for aspiring leaders to shine.</p>
