			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>The Multiple Sclerosis Mississauga Youth Committee (MSMYC) is a youth-run organization that advocates for awareness of multiple sclerosis in youth. As a non-profit organization that works closely with the MS Society of Canada, the <abbr title="Multiple Sclerosis Mississauga Youth Committee">MSMYC</abbr> was founded by Cathy Li in January 2012 in an effort to bring the issue of multiple sclerosis to the forefront of youth, while raising money towards finding a cure and enhancing the lives of those affected.</p>

			<h2>What is Multiple Sclerosis?</h2>
			<p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease, often progressive, that affects the central nervous system, resulting in loss of muscle control and sensation. While Canada has the highest incident rate of multiple sclerosis in the world, the majority of the youth populace remains unaware of this disease and its impact. To address this, the <abbr title="Multiple Sclerosis Mississauga Youth Committee">MSMYC</abbr> emphasizes awareness, education, and action through the youth populace. We place high value in the educational background of the disease, as it is an important step in understanding how to advocate for those facing <abbr title="multiple sclerosis">MS</abbr> as well as in sparking interest in the disease.</p>

			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>My first encounter with multiple sclerosis was at a volunteering event in grade nine. As a curious, science-loving student, I did not hesitate to investigate further into this disease and since then, I’ve worked with the MS Society of Canada as the Volunteer Coordinator of the MS Walk in Streetsville for the last three years. Having worked with both adult and youth volunteers, I realized that although the MS Society is successful in reaching out to adults, it was less successful in engaging the younger demographic. This was the fuelling agent to the start of the MS Youth Committee. I initiated this committee in hopes of inspiring others to take active measures in understanding this complex disease and become leaders in the fight against multiple sclerosis. I know that when given the opportunity, youth have the potential to make a significant impact in the world, especially in an area of concern, such as multiple sclerosis, that can affect anyone anytime. Already we have established a large network of student ambassadors in high schools across Mississauga, working together to promote awareness and understanding of multiple sclerosis through youth-oriented fundraisers and events. We’ve taken the first step, and I truly hope that youth, hand-in-hand, will join us in the movement for an MS-free future together.</p>

			<h2>Meet the Team</h2>
			<p><span id="openall">Open all</span></p>
			<h3>Angela Chao</h3>
			<p>Angela is a grade 12 student, currently enrolled in the Regional Enhanced Program at Glenforest Secondary School. During her free time, she loves to play volleyball, watch movies, and listen to classic rock music. Angela actively volunteers with the Credit Valley Hospital, AbleLiving Organization, and community sport camps. Through her involvement with MSMYC, she hopes to raise awareness among the voices of tomorrow to enable them to take action in support of the people who are affected by this devastating disease.</p>
			<h3>Allison Chen</h3>
			<p>Allison is a driven peer and leader who strives to consistently and actively participate within her school and community through various extracurriculars and volunteer engagements, which span across Interact, cross country,show choir, to volunteering at the hospital. Through her involvement with <abbr title="Multiple Sclerosis Mississauga Youth Committee">MSMYC</abbr>, she aims to encourage other youth to get involved and further develop the growth of mere interests into passions. Any spare time she has is dedicated, for the most part, to bettering herself and the community, with a vision to create an awareness of youth potential and engagement within the community to create long lasting positive change on our generation and the generations to follow.</p>
			<h3>Cathy Li</h3>
			<p>Cathy is currently completing her senior year in the International Baccalaureate Program. Aside from her involvement with the <abbr title="multiple sclerosis">MS</abbr> Society of Canada, she actively volunteers at her local hospital and is a Shad Valley Queen’s 2012 alumnus. As an avid musician and athlete, she teaches piano, and loves to be actively competing in sports, such as volleyball and soccer. On her long journey ahead, she hopes to inspire others to do things beyond their comfort zones.</p>
			<h3>Jessie Liu</h3>
			<p>Jessie Liu is a passionate high school student who is always full of energy. As an active member in both her school and community, she is involved in the International Baccalaureate Student League, Kicks for Kids, and several leadership conferences. Recently, Jessie had the experience of a lifetime volunteering in rural Kenya where she not only helped build a school, but gained a whole new appreciation for life. The children in Kenya taught her that happiness is unquantifiable and that each of us can be the change we want to see in this world.To Jessie, MSMYC is more than a leadership opportunity, it’s the engagement of youths to educate others, to help find a cure and most importantly, to be the change.</p>
			<h3>Neil Liu</h3>
			<p>Neil Liu is a vocal Grade 10 member in the community and attending the IB Program. As an active figure in the community, he was participated in many social events, as well as volunteered. I think the most important thing about MSMYC is the cooperation of students from different schools to accomplish a task and I really hope that we can make a difference. In my opinion, we youth can greatly benefit from participating in a community effort to support the excellent work of researchers and use this opportunity to get closer with our community, take an active role in an organization, exercise our leadership capabilities, and acquiring the skills we will need to apply throughout our lives. Raising money for a significant cause like the search for a cure for multiple sclerosis is, in my view, the perfect opportunity for aspiring leaders to shine.</p>
