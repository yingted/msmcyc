			<h2>Vision</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>My first encounter with multiple sclerosis was at a volunteering event in grade nine. As a curious, science-loving student, I did not hesitate to investigate further into this disease and since then, I’ve worked with the MS Society of Canada as the Volunteer Coordinator of the MS Walk in Streetsville for the last three years. Having worked with both adult and youth volunteers, I realized that although the MS Society is successful in reaching out to adults, it was less successful in engaging the younger demographic. This was the fuelling agent to the start of the MS Youth Committee. I initiated this committee in hopes of inspiring others to take active measures in understanding this complex disease and become leaders in the fight against multiple sclerosis. I know that when given the opportunity, youth have the potential to make a significant impact in the world, especially in an area of concern, such as multiple sclerosis, that can affect anyone anytime. Already we have established a large network of student ambassadors in high schools across Mississauga, working together to promote awareness and understanding of multiple sclerosis through youth-oriented fundraisers and events. We’ve taken the first step, and I truly hope that youth, hand-in-hand, will join us in the movement for an MS-free future together.</p>

In his opinion, youth can greatly benefit from participating in a community effort to support the excellent work of researchers and use this opportunity to get closer with their communities, take an active role in an organization, exercise their leadership capabilities, and acquire the skills they will need to apply throughout their lives. Raising money for a significant cause like the search for a cure for multiple sclerosis is, in his view, the perfect opportunity for aspiring leaders to shine.</p>
